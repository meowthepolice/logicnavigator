## Simulating

[Ken has provided YouTube videos showing how the simulator works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjFw23qwN5E).

Through the panel, it is possible to toggle tracks/calls on signals/points throughout the simulation.  The simulation will apply the full locking that the loaded interlocking data provides.

## Viewing Data

Logic Navigator provides an easy way to view interlocking data from many different kinds of interlocking.  The main interlockings that are supported are Westrace Mk1, Mk2 and Microlok II.

Logic Navigator provides a method of viewing live rungs during simulation, and toggling available inputs (inputs that are defined as an input to the interlocking) directly from the live rungs.

## Logic Navigator as a Learning Tool

Logic Navigator can be used to provide lessons to others interested in learning how different functions are implemented.  Above, and available on the weebly website as a download, a tutorial on how points swing is available.  This tutorial shows the different layers of protection including the different stages of points control.
